# Stylus Stuff [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com) is a dynamic stylesheet language that is compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Its design is influenced by Sass and LESS. It's regarded as the fourth most used CSS preprocessor syntax.  It was created by [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/tj), a former programmer for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the creator of the Luna language. It is written in [PUG](https://pugjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

This tiny project follows [GitHub community trend](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) to aggregate libraries, frameworks, and tools in the form of a handy well-structured collection. Here you will find tutorials and learning materials for Sublime Text, general purpose extensions for coding and text editing, and specialized extensions grouped by usage profiles.
